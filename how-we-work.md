# How we work

How Dwarves work.

## Project management

- Trello for customer-facing discussions and milestones planning
- GitLab for team-facing planning and task assigning

## Source control

- Git and GitLab ftw
- [Git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model for repository collaboration
