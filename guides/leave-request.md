# On-leave Process

A consistent on leave process prevents a company from being accidentally disrupted when an employee request to be absent. 
At our woodland, every time an employee submit a request for on leave or remote work, whether it is for half-shift or all day absence, the process shall be required to follow these following steps:

### 1. Request submission
Employee must submit the request within double the time he or she is absent. Employee is required to log in on the company's Basecamp channel and create a ticket on On-Leave Request list, with the detailed format as below:

* List : On-Leave Requests
* Ticket format: Name | Type of absence (off/remote) | Date | Shift (if any)
* Assign to: Line Manager

For example, if engineer Khiem Vo is planning to have his day off on both Jan 4th and Jan 5th, the request must be submitted 4 days in advance, which is Jan 1st. And Line Manager of Khiem Vo is Huy Nguyen. The request should be:

* List: On-Leave Requests
* Ticket: Khiem Vo | Off | Jan 4th - Jan 5th
* Assign to: Huy Nguyen

### 2. Notify and verification
Line Manager should notify Project Manager by email and cc Operation/ HR Department for their counsel of approval. 
In case the responsibility of this employee is involved in any project, a contingency strategy should be applied in order to prevent the working process from being interrupted or blocked. 

### 3. Approval/ Denial
After the approval/ denial decision has been made, Line Manager will inform the employee with an email of approval, along with a Google Calendar schedule. 

Line Manager will also mark done on the ticket which was assigned to him previously, and note down the employee's return date (if the request is approved) or the reason (if the request is denied)

### 4. Announcement
An email of announcement should be sent from Line Manager to the employee, Project Manager and Operation/HR for confirmation. In addition, a short message can be delivered informally to the related-team channel to notify other team members.
